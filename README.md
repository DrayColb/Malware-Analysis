<h1>Virtual Machine-Exploitation </h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project will demonstarte the exploitation of a virtual machine utilizing tools like Nmap, Metasploit, and Google. I will conduct a Nmap version scan on the vm, search Google for available CVE, and use Metasploit to gain access and find a file (Task2) that contains a flag. 



  
 <h2> Step 1. Open the virtual machine and utilize 'ifconfig' to ensure we have the ip address </h2>

<h2> Step 2. Open Kali Linux and conduct a version scan on the ip 192.168.1.16 using 'sudo nmap -sV'. Now lets choose port 21/ftp/version vsftpd 2.3.4 and search its CVE </h2>

<h2> Step 3. Google vsftpd 2.3.4 CVE </h2>

<h2> Step 4. Selecting the second link we see the year it was created (2011), the description (backdoor that opens a shell), and its exploitable score(10). So this vulnerability is very exploitable. </h2>

<h2> Step 5. Open Metaslpoit in Kali and search vsftpd 2.3.4. Here we see there are two modules. </h2>

![P5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d8b1eb4-a7e0-48b2-86b2-bad691562cb4)


<h2> Step 6. Selecting the second module with the 'use 1' command we gain access to the exploit. Using the 'show options' command we see an ip address is required for the RHOSTS(Remote Host).  </h2>

![P6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/797ca7e4-6c51-4cad-ab94-f73722c96756)

<h2> Step 7. Use the 'set RHOSTS' command and input the vm ip and show options again to ensure it has been plugged in.</h2>

![P7](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79fdeaa5-489e-4bfd-bb8a-7bcfac8d0eaf)


<h2> Step 8. Use the 'exploit' command to run the exploit on the vm and we see 1 shell session has been opened.</h2>

![P8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83680b8d-7be1-4b2a-ad6a-7c10278effe8)

<h2> Step 9. To ensure we have control over the vm we'll perform a ifconfig to check the ip address.  </h2>

![P9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086474d6-14f4-442b-88c2-1f880ef45aa5)


<h2>Step 10. Now to find the Flag in the Task1 directory we will use the 'cd home' then 'cd msfadmin' command. Using the ls command we'll see all the directories available and we see Task1. Using 'cd Task1' then 'ls' we see a file named Task2, now to read it we'll use 'cat Task2' and see our flag.  </h2>
